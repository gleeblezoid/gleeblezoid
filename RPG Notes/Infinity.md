Me/Will's xter: We worked on a job to catch a mole, Will's xter was the mock-up artist

Me/Dave's xter: I was a contractor on a job due to my stunt pilot skills, we got betrayed by the person who was meant to be providing the landing zone

## Session 1 - Road to Neoterra

We're on our first mission for O12 - we're being briefed by Jocasta Janus (CEO of a major company, Provedentia), her son recently went missing and we're being tasked to find him. We need to travel to Neoterra and find the son there (and "resolve" the situation). Our emergency contact on NeoTerra is a member of Haqqislam (Homa Kadyrova).

- We're allowed to carry a sidearm but no military equipment.
- We have the physical address of Jocasta Janus
- We have a number to call for when we arrive at NeoTerra
- We have the basic details for the son

<details><summary> Secret Note from handler </summary>
As you move through the shining chrome of the NeoTerra arrival terminal, you notice a run-down Retrovert coffee shop you recognise, sat towards the unfashionable end of the terminal, half-hidden by the gaudy pink neon of the souvenir shop next-door. Few NeoTerrans seem to patronise it, but you note a couple of the Spaceport staff hunched over tables, sipping drinks. One wears the patch of the 101 responders. 

When you order your drink from the gregarious Merovingian behind the counter, you see the expected Cyrillic letters in the machine code on the synthetic paper receipt, in a cypher you've used before. After spending a few seconds decoding it - you get the following:

Agent Nebraska: we believe Providential has significant dealings with several corporations on Ariadna with ties to terrorist elements you are familiar with, but have acted to keep their interests and activities concealed from us.

No proof has yet been forthcoming, but you have an opportunity: either covertly obtain evidence of their operations on Ariadna so we can step in officially - or speak with Janus covertly to try and ascertain what she is doing and dissuade her continued involvement. Given you will be responsible for both the safe return of her son, and the punishment of his kidnappers, I'm sure you establish something to offer her.
</details>

Jocasta's assisstant is called Philemina Perez

In the meeting with Jocasta:

` You see the room is rather messy - it looks like it's not been well cared for of late. You can see a red stain near the window that looks like it's been recently cleaned.`

There have been an upsurge in kidnappings of children.

The other kidnappings have been happening once a week every week for the past several months. Rosalind Corto has been blocked from investigating the school by Church.

No connections between the families of the kidnapped children, oldest is 13, serial killer suspected, and mostly kids who "would not be missed". DNA evidence found a past EOL L-host around 2 years old.

> There is a dealer called Jack Frost who deals in off-market L-hosts 

Rosalind has provided us with her files on all the kidnappings. We could potentially get files from the school by hacking, get Jack Frost or his files.

Will and I are going to go have words with the L-Host Jack Frost - possible concussive words with Jack Frost before hacking into his computer.

Phil is going to analyse the data from Rosalind Corto.

Dave is going to try to hack the school.

Ashan?

## Session 2 - The Murder Algorithm

Nimruz and I end up in a Nomad nightclub - this seemed slightly predictable.

Nimruz was probably up to something in there but I don't care as long as we get the job done.

We've gone to the establishment of Jack Frost and are trying to get information out of him.

The l-host was an old model - sold cheap. Recently purchased by a priest (Father Casey Rimbauld - never gone to the shop but has purchased half a dozen L-hosts of different types). There was a young woman who came in to pick up the L-Hosts and we have a picture of her, plus the credit card details of an account linked to Father Rimbauld.

There were at least 10 l-hosts in the dodgy batch. Father Rimbauld seems to have his own cube transfer capabilities - he bought the bodies without cubes, just in crates.

John, Abdul, and Noi are all setting up hacks.

Kidnapping took place 5 days ago from a bathroom on the second floor and no evidence was found beyond the DNA evidence and signs of a struggle.

Noi got into the employee records, one of the janitors has a next of kin listed as Kaia nearish the school and it looks like the employment records have recently been infiltrated and changed. 
This janitor record doesn't look legit.

Father Rimbauld is no longer employed by the church and used to be a cybersecurity professional employed by the church (seems like he was a spy/information gatherer).

He became increaingly erractic leading up to his resignation from the Church. Apparently did a lot of volunteer work and charity work. One of the more recent individuals he helped out is a woman called Kaia - he set her up in sheltered accomodation and became friends with her.

Rimbauld created a large academic work which we also stole (thanks Noi).

The targeted children are determined randomly, but we've discovered the seed to the randomness. John Casey's data analysis work has not only tracked the source of the random data which feeds the murder algorithm, he's cracked the algorithm so we can find the next victim.

### Things we might want to do next session:

- Tail the next victim
- Look into the academic work from Rimbauld
- Track down/trap Kaia
- Track down/trap Rimbauld

## Session 3 - Did anyone order pizza?

Crazy man doctrine:

- Adam Cadman is the name Rimbauld gives to his idea of the First Man
- He seems to draw equivalence between Aleph and God
- Rimbauld posits that there's patterns behind seemingly random occurrances and it's semi-convincing

We have Rimbauld's address and some information on him from Noi's hacking in the last session.

Nimruz starts digging into the public Mayanet presence for Rimbauld - Rimbauld seems to have gone off-grid for the past 6 weeks.


Abdul, Nimruz, and I are teaming up to stake out Rimbauld's address - we got attacked by a pair of l-hosts purchased by Rimbauld/Kaia

The apparently Spanish accented l-host who survived longer yelled "No mercy for deicides" at us.

We all got arrested after taking down the l-hosts, though Abdul managed to stabilise one of them.

### End of session:

- Alex, Nimruz, and Abdul all got arrested (though we're only just going into custody) 
- Surveillance has been set up on Kaia
- Surveillance and some information has been gathered on the next victim (Mikel Johanson)
- It's mid-afternoon on Saturday, we expect the kidnapping to take place on the day after

Kinna Cardasso - receptionist at Rimbauld's apartment building

## Session 4 - Orange is the New Black Hat

- My arm should heal up over the next day 

Looking into Kaia revealed some weird tech specs which all trace back to a company called Eschaton Electronics - this company has an abandoned facility in the north of the city.

I played John Casey's Geist - I have decided her personality's name is Valerie (aged "seen it all" woman from New York).

Kaia calls a cab and asks to be taken to "Our Lady of Sorrows" Church where she is comforted by Father Gaeus.

One of the attackers died due a massive hole in the torso, the one we got stable died "from a cube malfunction".

During the incident where Alex got shot emergency calling was disabled on all nearby devices - this would have required very elite hacking skills.

Rimbauld thought Aleph was God and that Aleph needed the completion of themselves by gaining a prophet.

Rimbauld is in the St Rafael sanctuary where he's being cared for (allegedly) after his psychotic break.

A set of L-hosts do indeed go after Mikel Johanson and are following him - even on his cool hoverboard.


### Next session:

Car chases car chases car chasing hoverboard

## Session 5 - Hack fast, hack furious

![Hack the car](https://media.giphy.com/media/low7gwxDpiijiCEWdd/giphy-downsized.gif)

Noi, Abdul, and John Casey have pursued Mikel Johanson on his hoverboard (who was being pursued by l-hosts).

Nimruz has gone to speak to Kaia so that we can track down Rimbauld. 

Turns out Kaia is actually a skilled social manipulator and so she and Nimruz have an interesting battle of wits.

Rimbauld is trying to assemble a messiah from the minds of the "chosen children" and himself.

Kaia confesses everything after some prodding - she was a gopher for a fake Father Rimbauld but is now terrified of the things that he made her do (though the man she worked with did not look like Rimbauld).

We managed to get some information on Rimbauld from Kaia's devices.

Now we're in a terrible car chase again. I did manage to do a barrel roll and yank Abdul out of his car into the main car.

We pulled up in front of the Eschaton Electronics warehouse when we followed the l-host taxi. 

Rimbauld replaced his original body with an L-host and also has a creepy serial killer wall.

We pasted the l-hosts (one literally with a hover taxi).

### Next session:

- We're burning the cubes of the l-hosts and handing the primary cube to Rosalind Corto
- We're getting Jocasta Janus to pay to restore all the kidnapped children's cubes (including her son)
- Working out how to get our gear back will be fun
- We need to return Mikel to his parents (either directly or via Rosalind Corto)

## Session 6 - Kick them in the mainframe

Genuinely super weird that Rimbauld had the money for 6 l-hosts.

Noi fucking aced a hack into the building network (4 momentum) - the building doesn't belong to Providential, it belongs to High Tide communications.

Noi hacked Providential and found:

- high value information on top secret secure builds (including exploits for those builds)
- information on offworld projects including mining projects in Ariadna linked to extremely dodgy families (including a massive one which is very criminal looking)

We managed to persuade Jocasta Janus to pay for the kids' resurrections and get us off the hook for the trial (plus we got our stuff back).


## Session 7 - Paradiso Lost

My mission is now to try and get an Adhesive Launcher (ADHL) - it's an anti-vehicle glue blob launcher ffs.

I got one!

We're being sent to Paradiso to investigate voodoo tech smuggling - there's Yu Jing and PanOceanian interest in the smuggling.

We are being deployed far away from the battle lines.

The primary goal is to investigate who is smuggling the voodoo tech and where.

A smugglers camp was destroyed recently but clearly the operation is ongoing.

The soldiers who discovered the bodies are available to be interviewed by us.

<details><summary> Secret Note from handler </summary>

It is disappointing you were unable to assist on NeoTerra.

That being the case, we ask that you find what you can about the Voodootech smuggling - and if you can obtain a sample of the technology, our scientists would appreciate it - though not enough to attract the ire of Aleph.

</details>

- We met up with our local contact who is working with Abigail (our O12 handler) in the local O12 office HQ.

- We've been asked to meet our contact Indigo Bipandra in a night club nearby.

- The soldiers who found the camp have a commander (Ping Hua) who we can meet with to get interview time with the soldiers.

- Fusilier Angus (he/him) - silly fusilier

- Fusilier Bipandra (she/her) - epic fusilier

- Nimruz' dog's name is Steve

- Nimruz and Alex failed to find the Angus dude, but it's cool because he went to another bar - so guess we better trek around to find him.

- There's a belief that a local corp is probably working with the smugglers given the use of a cargo freighter by the smugglers.

- Providential have a transport/logistics presence in the area and with a freight shipping contract.

- There's a large Yu Jing freight corp too but it's "above suspicion" because of its party ties.

- Yu Jing contact has told us that Bipandra is a loose cannon and less trustworthy than her partner Angus.

### Next session follow up with both halves of the group:

- PUB CRAWL!!!

![Steve knows what's what](https://media.giphy.com/media/ZVTCV8rPmymFa/giphy.gif)

## Session 8 - The Beef with Angus (the Dangus)

- We find Angus in a pub where a birthday party for Huang Li's 50th is going on - apparently he's a bigwig in the SubMondo of the planet.

- We led Angus out by promising pizza and leading him away, he's been followed and we're meant to meet in room 314 of a hotel that Bipandra picked out (The Long Hotel).

- Turns out Nimruz and I aren't great at shaking a tail so we're being pretty easily followed by some kind of shitty Batman ripoff.

- Angus the Dangus is an absolute potato

- YJITC is the YuJing shipping corp; Bipandra tried to break into the YJITC at midnight to grab the evidence and meet up in Angus's room after that

- Angus the Dangus has some copies of the evidence from the smuggling ring but his copies match what we have

Next session:

- Abigail is breaking Nimruz and Steve out of prison
- We need to decide where to stash Angus the Dangus
- We need to find Bipandra and learn more about the raid she made on YJITC
- Look into the Providential connection

## Session 9 - The Steve-shank Redemption

- We've now been given temporary Yănjīng agent status

- We've stashed Angus in the O12 Ops post

- We need to find Bapindra

- Searching Angus' room, Casey finds a Celestial Guard tag and what looks like a room card for 423,B (Bapindra's room)

- Bapindra's room contains a monitoring device that has been carefully deactivated, a brochure for the new local YJTC office advertising vacancies with a map of the YJTC building

- Bapindra seems to have taken her equipment with her

- In Angus' room there's a disabled listening device - but this one looks to have been overloaded electronically

- Noi and Nimruz got into the embassy; Nimruz physically with a lent repeater and Noi by hacking

- Noi now has uber permissions in the PanO embassy

- John Casey has profiled Bapindra with help from Nimruz to help with the search

- Lt. Ivonete Sosa is Bapindra's CO

- Based on how Angus got sent to meet us on his own and cut out of Bapindra's plans, I'm very convinced he's been dumped on us as a babysit job (kind of backed by Ted asking us to think about why he got sent to the bar).

Next session:

- We're going to investigate the break-in at YJTC by Bapindra to get our noses in there using our shiny new Yănjīng agent status

- We might also stake out the YJTC to see if Bapindra will turn up

- We might want to ask SubMondo about any connection to Bapindra

- Do we even care about Bapindra? Do we care more about what she went after and any potential connection to the voodoo tech? 

# Session 10 - Hack the Planet

- Noi and John are going to scope out the YJITC security (physical and digital)

- The reception area has a constant guard with a heavy weapon

- The networks in the building are Building, Employee, and Customer

- Kozu/Lee Jun is the person who gave us Yănjīng agent status

- Pin Hua is the person in Yujing who was working alongside Baprindra

- There was a routine security drill planned for midnight which Bapindra took advantage of, she came in through the front doors and hid in one of the cubicles until sneaking into the server room while taking down the guards. She then left the building and disappeared.

The city network then got hacked shortly afterwards.

Bapindra left the building and was picked up by a celestial guard patrol (she overpowered them and escaped), she stopped by the PanO embassy for about 30 mins and left again. The suspicion is that PanO are trying to gather evidence.

Chances are she's hiding outside the city or amongst PanO soldiers.

- Bapindra's actions suggest she anticipated being caught on surveillance and so either counted on PanO backing or figured it was worth it

- The shipping hub entrances are limited to 2 - main door and shipping hub

- Bapindra broke in wearing her uniform which suggests she'd be seen as a combatant rather than a spy - combatants get open sentences, spies get "disappeared"

- A worm was used to destroy a load of the data in the YJITC server room - it was very sophisticated (military grade) and it looks like the attack was initiated from a massively powerful computer in the city

- Two major sectors exist:
  - PanO Nation = Syldavia
  - Yu Jing = YingXian

- We met a Mongol raider who told us that Bapindra went into the Providential compound

# Session 11 - Providential

- There's a "plant" room which consumes a huge amount more power than expected

- There were 2 scary looking cool projects - "Equinox" and "The Ring"

- Discovered a entity called the "Heatwave Enclave" located on Bakunin mentioned in the Equinox files, Equinox is a terrorist org/movement who believe that humanity is on the wrong path.

- Providential are in cahoots with the combined army, a creepy alien helicopter broadcasting that it's a legit delivery vehicle visited and left the Providential base (filled with Morat troopers)

- The creepy helicopter went East when it left

- Bapindra got executed by the combined army, those were the 3 gunshots we heard

- Angus broke into the base with a pizza van, shortly before we broke in with a pizza van

- It looks like a lot of dodgy goods are being shipped to Svarlheim(probably the voodoo-tech)

- We found a reference to a Rosario Lena from Providential who is listed as kill on site by Providential
