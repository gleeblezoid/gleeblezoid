# Infinity

Me/Will's xter: We worked on a job to catch a mole, Will's xter was the mock-up artist
Me/Dave's xter: I was a contractor on a job due to my stunt pilot skills, we got betrayed by the person who was meant to be providing the landing zone

## Session 1

We're on our first mission for O12 - we're being briefed by Jocasta Janus (CEO of a major company, Provedentia), her son recently went missing and we're being tasked to find him. We need to travel to Neoterra and find the son there (and "resolve" the situation). Our emergency contact on NeoTerra is a member of Haqqislam (Homa Kadyrova).

- We're allowed to carry a sidearm but no military equipment.
- We have the physical address of Jocasta Janus
- We have a number to call for when we arrive at NeoTerra
- We have the basic details for the son

As you move through the shining chrome of the NeoTerra arrival terminal, you notice a run-down Retrovert coffee shop you recognise, sat towards the unfashionable end of the terminal, half-hidden by the gaudy pink neon of the souvenir shop next-door. Few NeoTerrans seem to patronise it, but you note a couple of the Spaceport staff hunched over tables, sipping drinks. One wears the patch of the 101 responders. 

When you order your drink from the gregarious Merovingian behind the counter, you see the expected Cyrillic letters in the machine code on the synthetic paper receipt, in a cypher you've used before. After spending a few seconds decoding it - you get the following:

Agent Nebraska: we believe Providentiae has significant dealings with several corporations on Ariadna with ties to terrorist elements you are familiar with, but have acted to keep their interests and activities concealed from us.

No proof has yet been forthcoming, but you have an opportunity: either covertly obtain evidence of their operations on Ariadna so we can step in officially - or speak with Janus covertly to try and ascertain what she is doing and dissuade her continued involvement. Given you will be responsible for both the safe return of her son, and the punishment of his kidnappers, I'm sure you establish something to offer her.
