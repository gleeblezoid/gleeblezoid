Me/Will's xter: We worked on a job to catch a mole, Will's xter was the mock-up artist

Me/Dave's xter: I was a contractor on a job due to my stunt pilot skills, we got betrayed by the person who was meant to be providing the landing zone

## Session 1 - Road to Neoterra

We're on our first mission for O12 - we're being briefed by Jocasta Janus (CEO of a major company, Provedentia), her son recently went missing and we're being tasked to find him. We need to travel to Neoterra and find the son there (and "resolve" the situation). Our emergency contact on NeoTerra is a member of Haqqislam (Homa Kadyrova).

- We're allowed to carry a sidearm but no military equipment.
- We have the physical address of Jocasta Janus
- We have a number to call for when we arrive at NeoTerra
- We have the basic details for the son

<details><summary> Secret Note from handler </summary>
As you move through the shining chrome of the NeoTerra arrival terminal, you notice a run-down Retrovert coffee shop you recognise, sat towards the unfashionable end of the terminal, half-hidden by the gaudy pink neon of the souvenir shop next-door. Few NeoTerrans seem to patronise it, but you note a couple of the Spaceport staff hunched over tables, sipping drinks. One wears the patch of the 101 responders. 

When you order your drink from the gregarious Merovingian behind the counter, you see the expected Cyrillic letters in the machine code on the synthetic paper receipt, in a cypher you've used before. After spending a few seconds decoding it - you get the following:

Agent Nebraska: we believe Providentiae has significant dealings with several corporations on Ariadna with ties to terrorist elements you are familiar with, but have acted to keep their interests and activities concealed from us.

No proof has yet been forthcoming, but you have an opportunity: either covertly obtain evidence of their operations on Ariadna so we can step in officially - or speak with Janus covertly to try and ascertain what she is doing and dissuade her continued involvement. Given you will be responsible for both the safe return of her son, and the punishment of his kidnappers, I'm sure you establish something to offer her.

Jocasta's assisstant is called Philemina Perez

In the meeting with Jocasta:

` You see the room is rather messy - it looks like it's not been well cared for of late. You can see a red stain near the window that looks like it's been recently cleaned.`

There have been an upsurge in kidnappings of children.

The other kidnappings have been happening once a week every week for the past several months. Rosalind Corto has been blocked from investigating the school by Church.

No connections between the families of the kidnapped children, oldest is 13, serial killer suspected, and mostly kids who "would not be missed". DNA evidence found a past EOL L-host around 2 years old.

> There is a dealer called Jack Frost who deals in off-market L-hosts 

Rosalind has provided us with her files on all the kidnappings. We could potentially get files from the school by hacking, get Jack Frost or his files.

Will and I are going to go have words with the L-Host Jack Frost - possible concussive words with Jack Frost before hacking into his computer.

Phil is going to analyse the data from Rosalind Corto.

Dave is going to try to hack the school.

Ashan?

## Session 2 - The Murder Algorithm

Nimruz and I end up in a Nomad nightclub - this seemed slightly predictable.

Nimruz was probably up to something in there but I don't care as long as we get the job done.

We've gone to the establishment of Jack Frost and are trying to get information out of him.

The l-host was an old model - sold cheap. Recently purchased by a priest (Father Casey Rimbauld - never gone to the shop but has purchased half a dozen L-hosts of different types). There was a young woman who came in to pick up the L-Hosts and we have a picture of her, plus the credit card details of an account linked to Father Rimbauld.

There were at least 10 l-hosts in the dodgy batch. Father Rimbauld seems to have his own cube transfer capabilities - he bought the bodies without cubes, just in crates.

John, Abdul, and Noi are all setting up hacks.

Kidnapping took place 5 days ago from a bathroom on the second floor and no evidence was found beyond the DNA evidence and signs of a struggle.

Noi got into the employee records, one of the janitors has a next of kin listed as Kaia nearish the school and it looks like the employment records have recently been infiltrated and changed. 
This janitor record doesn't look legit.

Father Rimbauld is no longer employed by the church and used to be a cybersecurity professional employed by the church (seems like he was a spy/information gatherer).

He became increaingly erractic leading up to his resignation from the Church. Apparently did a lot of volunteer work and charity work. One of the more recent individuals he helped out is a woman called Kaia - he set her up in sheltered accomodation and became friends with her.

Rimbauld created a large academic work which we also stole (thanks Noi).

The targeted children are determined randomly, but we've discovered the seed to the randomness. John Casey's data analysis work has not only tracked the source of the random data which feeds the murder algorithm, he's cracked the algorithm so we can find the next victim.

Things we might want to do next session:

- Tail the next victim
- Look into the academic work from Rimbauld
- Track down/trap Kaia
- Track down/trap Rimbauld

## Session 3 - Did anyone order pizza?

Crazy man doctrine:

- Adam Cadman is the name Rimbauld gives to his idea of the First Man
- He seems to draw equivalence between Aleph and God
- Rimbauld posits that there's patterns behind seemingly random occurrances and it's semi-convincing

We have Rimbauld's address and some information on him from Noi's hacking in the last session.

Nimruz starts digging into the public Mayanet presence for Rimbauld - Rimbauld seems to have gone off-grid for the past 6 weeks.


Abdul, Nimruz, and I are teaming up to stake out Rimbauld's address - we got attacked by a pair of l-hosts purchased by Rimbauld/Kaia

The apparently Spanish accented l-host who survived longer yelled "No mercy for deicides" at us.

We all got arrested after taking down the l-hosts, though Abdul managed to stabilise one of them.

End of session:

- Alex, Nimruz, and Abdul all got arrested (though we're only just going into custody) 
- Surveillance has been set up on Kaia
- Surveillance and some information has been gathered on the next victim (Mikel Johanson)
- It's mid-afternoon on Saturday, we expect the kidnapping to take place on the day after

## Session 4 - Orange is the New Black Hat

- My arm should heal up over the next day 

Looking into Kaia revealed some weird tech specs which all trace back to a company called Eschaton Electronics - this company has an abandoned facility in the north of the city.

I played John Casey's Geist - I have decided her personality's name is Valerie (aged "seen it all" woman from New York).

Kaia calls a cab and asks to be taken to "Our Lady of Sorrows" Church where she is comforted by Father Gaiaus.

One of the attackers died due a massive hole in the torso, the one we got stable died "from a cube malfunction".

During the incident where Alex got shot emergency calling was disabled on all nearby devices - this would have required very elite hacking skills.

Rimbauld thought Aleph was God and that Aleph needed the completion of themselves by gaining a prophet.

Rimbauld is in the St Rafael sanctuary where he's being cared for (allegedly) after his psychotic break.

A set of L-hosts do indeed go after Mikel Johanson and are following him - even on his cool hoverboard.


Next session:

Car chases car chases car chasing hoverboard
