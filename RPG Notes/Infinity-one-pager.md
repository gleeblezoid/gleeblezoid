# Infinity Rules Summary

## WOUND EFFECTS

The following effects can be used for Wounds suffered during a Warfare scene, or in any other circumstance where Wounds are inflicted.

**Bleeding:** The target gains the Bleeding condition. (This condition can be removed with the Absterge action, ending the Wound Effect.)

**Cripple:** Target suffers +1 difficulty on all Agility-, Brawn-, or Coordination-based actions.

**Dazed:** The target gains the Dazed condition. If they are already Dazed, they become Staggered. (This condition can be removed with the Absterge action, ending the Wound Effect.)

**Horrific Wound:**The target suffers 1+2§ (Vicious 1) Resolve damage.

**Knockout:** The target must make a Resistance test to avoid being rendered unconscious. The difficulty of the test is equal to the number of Wounds the character is currently suffering from. If the test is successful, the character still suffers the Wound, they merely avoid the Wound Effect.

## BREACH EFFECTS

The following effects can be used for Breaches suffered during an Infowar scene, or in any other circumstance where Breaches are inflicted.

**Blind:** If the target is using equipment with the Neural quality, a hacker can use a Breach Effect to force them to make a Resistance or Tech test to avoid becoming Blind. The difficulty of the test is equal to the number of Breaches the target is currently suffering from. If the test is successful, the character still suffers the Breach, they merely avoid the Breach Effect. (This condition can be removed with the Absterge action, ending the Breach Effect.)

**Brain Blast:** If the target is using equipment with the Neural quality, a hacker can choose to deal them a Wound instead of a Breach.

**Command System:** The hacker can force the target’s system to execute one command. This is often used to effect changes in the physical world, such as activating devices, unlocking doors, opening cockpits, controlling surveillance cameras, instruct- ing dronbots, firing a gun turret, manipulating environmental controls, or the like. Complicated instruction sets may require multiple Breach Effects to implement (at the GM’s discretion).

**Data Manipulation:** The hacker directly accesses the target’s files. They can delete information, alter data, create bogus records, hide information, and the like. They can’t dupe the entire system, but they could copy one file or limited set of files (such as all the security video from November 11th). If they’re attempting to glean specific information, they may ask one question and get an answer to it. Forgeries and the like may require face-to-face tests to determine whether or not the fraud
is believed.

**Disable Function:** One program or piece of equip- ment possessed by the target ceases to function. (Since the vast majority of equipment in the Human Sphere possesses some measure of connectivity, this can include virtually anything that doesn’t possess the Non-Hackable quality.) The hacker can also be very selective, disabling some functions
of a program or piece of equipment while leaving others intact.

**Lock Connection:** The target cannot disconnect from the current system. An Absterge action can be used to clear this effect.

**Revoke Authentication:** An authentication possessed by the target (usually to the current system) is revoked. The revocation is permanent and the authentication is not restored even when the Breach is removed, although nothing prevents the character from gaining new authentication on the system.

**System Disruption:** The target suffers +1 difficulty to any actions requiring use of equipment with the Comms Equipped or Expert qualities (including their comlog).

**Spoof/Sniff:** The hacker duplicates the system ID
of the target, giving them authentication for one system that the target has access to. The hacker can spend Momentum to either improve the quality of the authentication (making their spoof harder to detect) or to gain additional authentication (one per Momentum).

**Tag:** The hacker tags the target system. This allows them to track the target. In addition, they can use a tagged target as a repeater.

## METANOIA EFFECTS

The following effects can be applied whenever Metanoia is inflicted during a Psywar scene, or in any other circumstance where Metanoia is inflicted.

**Break Social Connection:** A dyadic link connecting the target to another social zone is broken. Remove the link from the social network map.

**Create Social Connection:** A dyadic link is created between the target and another social zone. (This might represent convincing them to join an organ- isation, swearing a blood oath to destroy their new archenemy, booking them to perform at a concert, or moving them into a safe house.)

**Emotional State:** The effect creates an emotional state in the target. (Common options might include panic, suspicion, trust, lust, and the like.)
Force an Action: The target is forced, convinced, or otherwise compelled to attempt a particular action. (This might include evincing a confession, con- vincing them to lay down their arms and engage in negotiation, invest in a particular stock, or any number of things.) These are generally specific actions carried out immediately. Long-term services will usually have higher Intransigence scores.

**Forge Friendship:** The target becomes friends with someone (usually the person interacting with them, although a good wingman might be able to hook them up with someone else).

**Gain Information:** This does not necessarily mean getting the target to openly reveal the information in question. You might bluff them into glancing at where they’ve hidden an object. Or do enough social data mining to crack their password.

**Gain/Lose Access:** As a Metanoia Effect, a char- acter can gain (or lose) access to a dyadic link (see p. 125).

**Influence Belief:** Convince the target that something is true (whether it is or not). This can extend to altering their personal value system and reasoning, or at least temporarily being willing to ignore them.
Monitor: Learn what actions the target is taking in the “real world” by collecting gossip, having them followed, questioning their associates, or the like.
