## Traits/spells/abilities

- WordPlay (Air)
Types: Interpersonal, Mental
Effects: The following apply to a character with the Wordplay passion:
    - You can always identify rhetorical and literary patterns in the works of others when reading or listening to them.
    - After performing a check to interpret or create a play on words (such as a Composition [Air] check to write a poem with a perfectly execut- poetic pun or a Performance [Air] check to subtly imply something to your audience via a double meaning), you remove 3 strife.

- Benten’s Curse (Air)

    - Your romantic efforts are always stymied by circumstances, and your gestures to get the romantic attention of others are usually misinterpreted.

    - When you make a check to express your admiration to someone (such as an Aesthetics [Air] check to find the right poem to read to express your feelings or a Courtesy [Air] check to tell someone your feelings without exceeding propriety), you must choose and reroll two dice containing success or double success. After resolving the check, if you failed, you gain 1 Void point.

- Fox Spirit (School Ability):

    Your true form is that of a large fox with up to eight tails if you are a full-blooded kitsune, or a human with certain vulpine traits if
    you possess human ancestry as well.

    As a Scheme and Support action, you may transform between your human and true forms, or into another silhouette 1 or 2 natural creature at the GM’s discretion (you cannot mimic specific individuals). Observers with vigilance lower than or equal to your school rank plus your ranks in Performance do not detect any flaws in your façade. However, certain key features persist across all of your forms. If you become Compromised, your disguise slips.

- Nature’s Touch Rank 1
shinjo's Whispers (Ancestral), run Alongside the ki-rin (Fortunist), voice oF the glen king (Foreign)

    To perform this rite, the shugenja seeks Chikushō-dō, the Realm of Animals, in the world around them and in their own heart. This allows the shugenja to communicate with (though not dominate) animals of the mortal realm.

    Activation: As a Support action, you may make a TN 1 Theology (Air) check targeting yourself.

    Effects: If you succeed, you augment yourself with the ability to speak to animals of the natural world (but not Otherworldly or Tainted beings). Animals can under- stand you (within their ability to do so, naturally— human political relationships will have no meaning to horses, no matter how many times you explain them). They are not compelled to obey you, however. This effect persists until the end of the scene.

    New Opportunities

    Air : Until the end of the scene, you can understand animals’ speech.
    Air : If you succeed, the animal also acts favorably toward you automatically due to your politeness, ful- filling one request that does not put it in danger with- out having to be convinced with bribes of food or subsequent checks.
    Air  : If you succeed, you can communicate with an Otherworldly being this way, provided it has anything to say to you.

- Token of Memory Rank 1
riddle oF Agasha (AncestrAl), trick oF the Air kAmi (elemental), eBisu's joke (Fortunist)

    After performing this invocation, the shugenja conjures an illusion from the air, a trick of the light captured in hand.

    Activation: As a Scheme action, you may make a TN 2 Theology (Air) check targeting one position at range 0–1


    Effects: If you succeed, you summon an illusion of one inanimate object at the target position. The illusory object’s size is a silhouette of up to your bonus successes (beginning at 0, or a small handheld object). The item appears real, but it does not actually exist, and it cannot be used. Any character confronted with one of these illusions must resist with a TN 4 Artisan, Smithing, or Design check (Earth 5, Fire 2) using a Scholar skill approach to discern its illusory nature. The object persists until the end of the scene.

    New Opportunities

    Air : The object can appear to be a creature or person (though it does not move).

    Air +: Summon one additional illusory object in range per  spent this way.

    Air  : Illusory objects you summon this way have mass, and they can be used as if they were real (though they are still inanimate, and thus do not move on their own). They still vanish when the effect ends.

- Commune with the Spirits Rank 1

    Activation: As a downtime activity or Support action, you may make a TN 1 Theology check using Air, Earth, Fire, Water, or Void to appeal to nearby spirits of that Element (appeal to the departed, such as ancestor spirits, and other non-elemental supernatural presenc- es, if using Void) for aid.

    Effects: If you succeed, choose and receive one of the following boons from the spirit or spirits you contacted:

    $ Sense the Kami: Detect all spirits and uses of their magic by shugenja within a number of range bands equal to the ring you used plus your bonus successes.

    $ Spiritual Knowledge: Learn one fact the spirits know about the area.

    $ Elemental Gift: The kami deliver a small amount of the Element in question to you. For instance, a prayer to a water kami might cause it to begin raining lightly, for a short time, but it might also cause you to run across a stream, or even find groundwater. In contrast, a prayer to fire kami might bring forth a small shower of sparks, while a prayer to an air kami might elicit a gust of wind. Praying to an earth kami might cause you to stumble across a large stone, or find a small patch of arable ground amid a wasteland. Prayers to the ancestors may allow the petitioner to find something that belonged to an ancestor in a time of need.

    New Opportunities
    : Reduce the TN of your next check to interact with or appeal to kami or supernatural presences of this Element by 1.
    +: If you succeed, receive one additional boon per  spent this way. Each boon can only be received one time per activation.

- False Identity (Air)

    Types: Interpersonal
    Effects: The following apply to a character with the False Identity anxiety:

    $ You have an elaborate false identity that you have maintained over a long period of time. Many of the people you interact with regularly know you by this identity, and you may even have a family that does not know the truth.

    $ After performing a check to maintain your false identity (such as a Courtesy [Air] check to lie about your past or a Skulduggery [Air] check to surreptitiously hide evidence of the truth), you receive 3 strife. If this is the first time this has occurred this scene, gain 1 Void point.

- JuroJin’s Blessing (Void)
  - Types: Physical, Spiritual
- Effects: The following apply to a character with the Jurojin’s 
- Blessing distinction:
    $ You do not contract mundane diseases, and you recover from poisons and supernatural maladies in half the time it would take someone else.
    $ When performing a check for which you need to survive and remain vital (such as a Fitness [Void] check to resist spiritual contamination or a Survival [Void] check to get by on bare minimum supplies), you may reroll up to two dice.
