# Poems beyond the wall

## Lion Lion

Lion Lion, screaming fight
in the forest full of blight
with Matsu rage and ringing sound
cut your foes down to the ground

In what shadows can they hide
from the lion's battle cries?
Honour held and glory soars
monsters fall, the lion roars

Past the walls, sword in hand
Deep within the Shadowlands
Awaken in the stolid crab
the wrath to charge to war and stab

Where the hammer? Where the sword?
That blurred upon the cursed sward
Here the clearing past the wall
The Shadows fear the Lion's call

## Cake is a lie

The wall behind us
Shadowlands show us sweet things
The cake is a lie
