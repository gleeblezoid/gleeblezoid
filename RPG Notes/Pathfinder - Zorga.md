# In next week's episode...
- The party ventures into the tower they just climbed all over and looted

# Quest
- Investigate the Wellspring Tower
	- 	People have been disappearing from the roads and the town - is this linked to the tower?
	- 	The Swardlands seem to be cursed and Opper fears this is centred on him
		- 	Opper has been having nightmares and after his bad dreams someone always dies within 24 hours
			- 	He would like us to help with this
	- 	Reward from Opper: 250 GP and lodgings in his house for the meantime
- Gudfast - Dead (we have the Gudfast house marked on a map after a Gudfast grandchild approached us)
- The murdered shoony youngsters: found nailed to trees south of Stump with parts of their brains cut out
- The Old Forest Tower is broken too

# Session One

- The contact from the Consortium that hired the Pathfinder society to investigate this madness is Opper Vandy
- Opper Vandy is an undertaker who works in a mortuary just outside the city
- The Swardlands are regarded as an agrarian paradise which invest in lots of magical agri-tech: there are a lot of magical natives and manifested creatures/phenomena though so it's pretty dangerous at times.
- The biggest event in the place's past was when a pair of mad dwarves tried to raise a huge army
- The towers of Aradin in the area are seen as huge totems of luck and so farmers take offerings to them
- The nearby Wellspring Tower has been acting strangly of late - the spring that pours from it has gone foul and crops nearby have started failing
- The deceased person in Opper's house was called Homber Huttonfell
- 7 years ago Vandy paid for the burial of a Yungor Swinten - this looks like the only time he's paid for a burial. Rogor Swinten's funeral was also covered and was at least a decade ago (we found a receipt with the costs zeroed out). There is also a Tandy Swinten.
- There's a place called Verdant Passage which is the way to Matton Cleave (a nearby farming town)
- Priest - Jermaig (normally based in Kerrick) went to Turpin Row (which Kylk and I went through because it's on the Morovian Road which we used to travel in).
- Kerrick sells fancy magic items (probably mostly agricultural stuff)

# Session 2

- Taking an abandoned path in our search for land sharks we find an old farmhouse. The land around is covered in a yellow blight and the house is wel built but abandoned.
- The abandoned house and the ghost in it is linked to the Swintens
- The blight gets worse as you travel eastward
- The mayor of Matten Claeve is called Marta
- Laishari in Ferny is a wagon builder (who has been endorsed by their In-Law )
- There are allegedly land sharks in the hollows in Castinlee near Cawshax, and Turpin Rowe
- There are no pie barms in this gods-forsaken place
- Pipeweed is great in Ferny
- Some spells can be used to keep the yellowing under control
- Sounds like the yellowing has been linked to the Wellspring Tower
- The main office in Kerrick is holding the regional records on the investigation of the deaths
- There was a man called Bertrand Cullen who lived around the Swintens (he was often jailed and known by the local guard as a troublemaker), south of the Swinten house
- Prufira Stillberry - Northern Neigbours of Cullen.
- Marta Lieschari- Mayor of Matten Cleeve
- Jayn Brushwind - Halfling Constable from Matten Cleave
> Gudfast - Dead (we have the Gudfast house marked on a map after a Gudfast grandchild approached us)

# Session 3 & 4
- We killed the Xul'gaths around the tower but one got in 
- Bones of cows and other things in the entrance to the tower
- We smashed some golems, it was great
- There's a corridor full of dart traps and also a Roper mimic monster at the entrance
- I jumped through a ceiling hole and we fixed the tower 

# Session 5 - The Journey to Ferny
- Bolumo the Sherriff (and Mayor) is based in the centre of Ferny
- The Gudfast home was basically empty and derelict
- We headed back to Matton Cleave as an overnight before heading to Stump

# Session 6 - Pasta the Point of No Return
- Opper Vandy is hedging and obfuscating (he's hiding something from us)
- We found the footprints of a small human outside of Opper Vandy's bedroom and going around the front of the house
- "Tanner was right, we're doomed" is what the bandits on the road who attacked us yelled and they tried heading south east to escape
- Tanner is the brother of the woman (Tenessa) who instigated the attempted robbery of us and the gang
- We found a 100GP symbol of a nature god in the bandit camp
- The Fleers crossbows are magical and very valuable
- We took Tanner with us (he's got some abyssal illness) - he's having nightmares about dark horses coming for him and he needs revenge
