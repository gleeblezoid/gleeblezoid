# In next week's episode...
- We talk to the, now cheering, humans at the distillery who were presumably being attacked by zulgaths (which we killed when we got there)

# Quest
- Investigate the Wellspring Tower
	- 	People have been disappearing from the roads and the town - is this linked to the tower?
	- 	The Swardlands seem to be cursed and Opper fears this is centred on him
		- 	Opper has been having nightmares and after his bad dreams someone always dies within 24 hours
			- 	He would like us to help with this
	- 	Reward from Opper: 250 GP and lodgings in his house for the meantime
- Gudfast - Dead (we have the Gudfast house marked on a map after a Gudfast grandchild approached us)
- The murdered shoony youngsters: found nailed to trees south of Stump with parts of their brains cut out
- The Old Forest Tower is broken too

# Session One

- The contact from the Consortium that hired the Pathfinder society to investigate this madness is Opper Vandy
- Opper Vandy is an undertaker who works in a mortuary just outside the city
- The Swardlands are regarded as an agrarian paradise which invest in lots of magical agri-tech: there are a lot of magical natives and manifested creatures/phenomena though so it's pretty dangerous at times.
- The biggest event in the place's past was when a pair of mad dwarves tried to raise a huge army
- The towers of Aradin in the area are seen as huge totems of luck and so farmers take offerings to them
- The nearby Wellspring Tower has been acting strangly of late - the spring that pours from it has gone foul and crops nearby have started failing
- The deceased person in Opper's house was called Homber Huttonfell
- 7 years ago Vandy paid for the burial of a Yungor Swinten - this looks like the only time he's paid for a burial. Rogor Swinten's funeral was also covered and was at least a decade ago (we found a receipt with the costs zeroed out). There is also a Tandy Swinten.
- There's a place called Verdant Passage which is the way to Matton Cleave (a nearby farming town)
- Priest - Jermaig (normally based in Kerrick) went to Turpin Row (which Kylk and I went through because it's on the Morovian Road which we used to travel in).
- Kerrick sells fancy magic items (probably mostly agricultural stuff)

# Session 2

- Taking an abandoned path in our search for land sharks we find an old farmhouse. The land around is covered in a yellow blight and the house is wel built but abandoned.
- The abandoned house and the ghost in it is linked to the Swintens
- The blight gets worse as you travel eastward
- The mayor of Matten Claeve is called Marta
- Laishari in Ferny is a wagon builder (who has been endorsed by their In-Law )
- There are allegedly land sharks in the hollows in Castinlee near Cawshax, and Turpin Rowe
- There are no pie barms in this gods-forsaken place
- Pipeweed is great in Ferny
- Some spells can be used to keep the yellowing under control
- Sounds like the yellowing has been linked to the Wellspring Tower
- The main office in Kerrick is holding the regional records on the investigation of the deaths
- There was a man called Bertrand Cullen who lived around the Swintens (he was often jailed and known by the local guard as a troublemaker), south of the Swinten house
- Prufira Stillberry - Northern Neigbours of Cullen.
- Marta Lieschari- Mayor of Matten Cleeve
- Jayn Brushwind - Halfling Constable from Matten Cleave
> Gudfast - Dead (we have the Gudfast house marked on a map after a Gudfast grandchild approached us)

# Session 3 & 4

- We killed the Xul'gaths around the tower but one got in 
- Bones of cows and other things in the entrance to the tower
- We smashed some golems, it was great
- There's a corridor full of dart traps and also a Roper mimic monster at the entrance
- I jumped through a ceiling hole and we fixed the tower 

# Session 5 - The Journey to Ferny

- Bolumo the Sherriff (and Mayor) is based in the centre of Ferny
- The Gudfast home was basically empty and derelict
- We headed back to Matton Cleave as an overnight before heading to Stump

# Session 6 - Pasta the Point of No Return

- Opper Vandy is hedging and obfuscating (he's hiding something from us)
- We found the footprints of a small human outside of Opper Vandy's bedroom and going around the front of the house
- "Tanner was right, we're doomed" is what the bandits on the road who attacked us yelled and they tried heading south east to escape
- Tanner is the brother of the woman (Tenessa) who instigated the attempted robbery of us and the gang
- We found a 100GP symbol of a nature god in the bandit camp
- The Fleers crossbows are magical and very valuable
- We took Tanner with us (he's got some abyssal illness) - he's having nightmares about dark horses coming for him and he needs revenge

# Session 7 & 8 - BEST DAY EVER

- We took Tanner to a nearby sanctuary of Saranrae which was a winery
- Tanner was terrified of Night Mares and it looks like he was even killed by one in the middle of the night. The abbot of the winery was attacked and suffered a minor injury.
- We learned about a pseudo-religious order called the Hell Knights from the abbot as he mentioned they were one of the few parties who might have been motivated to go after a criminal but it's unlikely they'd be linked to Night Mares (which are abyssal)
- The abbot tells us that whatever is after us or Tanner (that we probably pissed off) seems like it could be powerful enough to ruin a province.
- We walk along to Stump which seems to be dilapidated and surrounded by over logged land which is now barren and sparse.
- I HAVE A PAPOOSE!!!
- I spent all my gold for the setup of a halfling-style eating contest, I regret nothing
- We found out from a few people now that the nearby vodka distillery has been shut down mysteriously
- Also cows have been going missing

KYLK GOT TO ZERO - HE ATE THE WHOLE STEAK

## Turpin Rowe
- Miss Landra and Mr Fi were killed
- We got approached by grey robed figures saying that we are not welcome in the forest and to leave
- We got to the distillery and it was, obvs, full of Zulgaths who we killed
