Our most important user journey is the one that generates all our revenue: users buying in-game currency via in-app purchases. Requests to the Play Store are only visible from the client. 

We see between 0.1 and 1 completed purchase every second; this spikes to 10 purchases per second after the release of a new area as players try to meet its requirements

This assignment will be graded along two axes:

The set of SLIs you choose and what parts of the journey they do or don't cover.
The measurement strategies you choose and the justification for your choices.

# SLI Specifications
As a user I want to:

- Be able to _quickly_ and _reliably_ open the "buy stuff" UI
- Choose the amount of in-game currency I want to buy
- Pay the correct amount for the items quickly 
- See that my in-game currency balance has updated quickly and correctly

As an engineer I know:

- Requests _to_ the Play Store are visible only from the client
- We do get status codes from the play store when a purchase is completed
